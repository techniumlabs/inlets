## Intro

inlets &reg; is how you connect services between different networks. You won't have to think about managing firewalls, NAT or VPNs again. Services can be tunnelled securely over a websocket and accessed on a remote network privately, or exposed on the Internet using an exit-server (5-10USD / mo).

Why do we need this project? Similar tools such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and [Argo Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/argo-tunnel/) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) are closed-source, have limits built-in, can work out expensive, and have limited support for arm/arm64, Docker and Kubernetes. Ngrok's domain is also often banned by corporate firewall policies meaning it can be unusable. Other open-source tunnel tools are designed to only set up a single static tunnel.

With inlets you can set up your own self-hosted tunnel, copy over the static binary and start tunnelling traffic without any arbitrary limits or restrictions. When used with TLS, inlets can be used with most corporate HTTP proxies.

## About inlets OSS

inlets OSS uses a websocket to create a tunnel between a client and a server. The server is typically a machine with a public IP address, and the client is on a private network with no public address.

inlets OSS is for hobbyists only and has no guarantee or warranty of any kind.

For a commercially-supported solution, see [inlets PRO](https://inlets.dev/), which has secure defaults and thorough testing.

### Private or public tunnels?

* A private tunnel is where you start a tunnel to a server and only expose it on the server's LAN address (this can replace the use-cases where you would use a VPN or Kubernetes federation)
* A public tunnel is where you expose the private service to users via the server's public IP

### Features

* Tunnel HTTP or websockets
* Expose a site on through the use of a DNS entry and a `Host` header
* Upgrade to link encryption using TLS for websockets (`wss://`) with an external add-on or [inlets PRO](https://inlets.dev)
* Shared authentication token for the client and server
* Automatic reconnects for when the connection drops

Distribution:

* Source code only

inlets PRO ships binaries with support for ARM and Windows computers. There is also an official public Docker image available.

### Going to production with inlets PRO

The following features / use-cases are covered by [inlets PRO](https://inlets.dev):

* Tunnel L4 TCP traffic such as websockets, databases, reverse proxies, remote desktop, VNC and SSH
* Tunnel L7 HTTPS / REST traffic - with automated Let's Encrypt support and multiple upstreams
* Expose multiple ports from the same client - i.e. 80 and 443
* Kubernetes helm charts, YAML and [Operator](https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator)
* Automated TLS for the control-plane
* Commercial services & support
* Documentation, blog posts, tutorials and videos

### inlets projects

inlets is a Cloud Native Tunnel and is [listed on the Cloud Native Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/category=service-proxy&format=card-mode&grouping=category&sort=stars) under *Service Proxies*.

* [inlets PRO](https://inlets.dev) - Secure HTTP(s) and TCP tunnels with automated TLS encryption. Replaces inlets OSS
* [inlets-operator](https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator) - Public IPs for your private Kubernetes Services and CRD using inlets PRO
* [inletsctl](https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl) - The fastest way to create self-hosted exit-servers using inlets PRO
* [inlets](https://github.com/inlets/inlets) - Cloud Native Tunnel for HTTP only - **no** tutorials, automation, TLS, TCP or Kubernetes integration available. Superseded by inlets PRO

## inlets PRO

inlets PRO supersedes the original inlets OSS project and includes: commercial support, automation, secure defaults, and HTTPS/TCP tunnels.

In "A tale of two networks" Alex Ellis and Johan Siebens explore blog posts, use-cases and show demos of inlets PRO.

### Quickstart tutorial

You can run inlets between any two computers with connectivity, these could be containers, VMs, bare metal or even "loop-back" on your own laptop.

Try the [quickstart tutorial now](./docs/quickstart.md) on your local computer.
